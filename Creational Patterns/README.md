# Creational Patterns

Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process.They help make a system independent of how its objects are created,composed, and represented.

Creational patterns become important as systems evolve to depend more on object composition than class inheritance.

There are `two` recurring themes in these patterns. First, they all encapsulate knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses. Second, they hide how instances of these classes are created and put together. All the system at large knows about the objects is their interfaces as defined by abstract classes. Consequently, the creational patterns give you a lot of flexibility in `what` gets created, `who` creates it, `how` it gets created, and `when`. They let you configure a system with "product" objects that vary widely in structure and functionality.
