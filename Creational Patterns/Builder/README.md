# Builder

## Objective

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

## Applicability

Use the Builder pattern when :

- The algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object and how they're assembled.
- The construction process must allow different representations for the object that's constructed.

## Implementation

```Java
class Product {
    // You can use any data structure that you prefer. We have used LinkedList here.
    private LinkedList<String> parts;

    public Product() {
        parts = new LinkedList<String>();
    }

    public void Add(String part) {
        // Adding parts
        parts.addLast(part);
    }

    public void Show() {
        System.out.println("\nProduct completed as below :");
        for (int i = 0; i < parts.size(); i++) {
            System.out.println("\t"+parts.get(i));
        }
    }
}
```

Starting off by making a Product class that contains the parts we want to add to each product.

```Java
interface IBuilder {
    void BuildPC();
    void InsertCPU();
    void InsertGPU();
    void AddRAM();
    Product GetPC();
}
```

The IBuilder interface is implemented by all the ConcreteBuilder classes.

```Java
class Director {
    IBuilder myBuilder;

    // A series of stepsâ€”for the production
    public void Construct(IBuilder builder) {
        myBuilder = builder;
        myBuilder.BuildPC();
        myBuilder.InsertCPU();
        myBuilder.InsertGPU();
        myBuilder.AddRAM();
    }
}
```

The client creates the Director object and configures it with the desired Builder object.
In this Construct method we choose to add all the parts, but you can easily choose the parts you want to add simply by not calling the add-method of that particular part in the director Construct method.

![client-builder relation](Builder-Director.PNG)

Director notifies the builder whenever a part of the product should be built.

Builder handles requests from the director and adds parts to the product.

The client retrieves the product from the builder.

```Java
// MyPC is ConcreteBuilder
class MyPC implements IBuilder {
    private Product product = new Product();

    @Override
    public void BuildPC() {
        product.Add("My PC has :");
    }

    @Override
    public void InsertCPU() {
        product.Add("\tIntel i9 CPU");
    }

    @Override
    public void InsertGPU() {
        product.Add("\tRTX 3060 GPU");
    }

    @Override
    public void AddRAM() {
        product.Add("\t32GB RAM");
    }

    @Override
    public Product GetPC() {
        return product;
    }
}
```

The first ConcreteBuilder we made is a class called MyPC that builds the PC parts for me.

```Java
// OthersPC is a ConcreteBuilder
class OthersPC implements IBuilder {
    private Product product = new Product();

    @Override
    public void BuildPC() {
        product.Add("Your PC has :");
    }

    @Override
    public void InsertCPU() {
        product.Add("\tRyzen 9 CPU");
    }

    @Override
    public void InsertGPU() {
        product.Add("\tRX 7800 XT GPU");
    }

    @Override
    public void AddRAM() {
        product.Add("\t16GB RAM");
    }

    @Override
    public Product GetPC() {
        return product;
    }
}
```

The second ConcreteBuilder we made is a class called OthersPC that builds the PC parts for other people.

```Java
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("***Builder Pattern Demo***");
        Director director = new Director();
        IBuilder myPCBuilder = new MyPC();
        IBuilder yourPCBuilder = new OthersPC();
        // Making My PC
        director.Construct(myPCBuilder);
        Product p1 = myPCBuilder.GetPC();
        p1.Show();
        // Making Your PC
        director.Construct(yourPCBuilder);
        Product p2 = yourPCBuilder.GetPC();
        p2.Show();
    }
}
```

Now we run this code to test the design pattern and the output should be :

```Terminal
***Builder Pattern Demo***

Product completed as below :
        My PC has :
                Intel i9 CPU
                RTX 3060 GPU
                32GB RAM

Product completed as below :
        Your PC has :
                Ryzen 9 CPU
                RX 7800 XT GPU
                16GB RAM
```

## Consequences

Here are key consequences of the Builder pattern:

- It lets you vary a product's internal representation.
- It isolates code for construction and representation.
- It gives you finer control over the construction process.

## Related Patterns

[Abstract Factory](../Abstract%20Factory/README.md) is similar to Builder in that it too may construct complex objects. The primary difference is that the Builder pattern focuses on constructing a complex object step by step. Abstract Factory's emphasis is on families of product objects (either simple or complex). Builder returns the product as a final step, but as far as the Abstract Factory pattern is concerned, the product gets returned
immediately.
A [Composite](https://) is what the builder often builds.
