# Design Patterns

The design patterns are descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve
a general design problem in a particular context.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over
and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution
to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times
over, without ever doing it the same way twice

## Elements of Design Patterns

Each design pattern consists of **four** essential elements:

1. `The pattern's name` is a handle we can use to describe a design problem.
2. `The Problem` describes when to apply the pattern.
3. `The Solution` describes the elements that make up the design.
4. `The consequences` are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern.

## Purpose of Design Patterns

### [Creational Patterns](./Creational%20Patterns/README.md)

Creational patterns concern the process of object creation.

### [Structural Patterns](./Structural%20Patterns/README.md)

Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes or objects.

### [Behavioral Patterns](./Behavioral%20Patterns/README.md)

Behavioral patterns characterize the ways in which classes or objects interact and distribute responsibility.
